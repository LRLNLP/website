#### Liability for content

As a service provider, Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz GmbH (DFKI) is responsible under general law for its own content published on this website in accordance with Section 7 para. 1 of the German Telemedia Act (TMG).

DFKI makes every effort to keep the information on this website accurate and current, nevertheless, errors and uncertainties cannot be entirely ruled out. For this reason, DFKI undertakes no liability for ensuring that the provided information is current, accurate or complete, and is not responsible for its quality. DFKI is not liable for material or immaterial damages caused directly or indirectly by the use or non-use of the offered information, or by the use of erroneous and incomplete information, unless willful or grossly negligent fault can be demonstrated. This also applies with respect to software or data provided for download.

DFKI reserves the right to modify, expand or delete parts of the website or the entire website without separate announcement, or to cease publication temporarily or definitively.

#### Liability for links

Pursuant to Section 7 para. 1 of TMG (German Tele-Media Act), the law limits our responsibility as a service provider to our own content on this website. According to Sections 8 – 10 TMG, we are not obliged to permanently monitor any transmitted or stored third-party information, nor to investigate circumstances that might indicate illegal activity. This does not affect our obligation to remove or block information according to general law. However, we can only assume liability for such data from the point in time at which a concrete legal infringement has been identified. Upon notification of any such legal infringement, we will immediately delete the infringing content.

Cross-references (“links”) to the content providers are to be distinguished from our own content. Our offer includes links to external third-party websites. Providers or operators of linked external pages are always responsible for their respective content. We cannot assume any liability for the content of the linked pages. This third-party content was checked by DFKI when the links were first set up to determine whether any legal infringements existed. At the time of the check, no legal infringements were apparent. However, it cannot be ruled out that the content is subsequently changed by the respective providers. A permanent control of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without evidence of a legal infringement. Should you believe that the linked external pages infringe applicable law or otherwise contain inappropriate content, please notify us directly at:
philipp.mueller@dfki.de

In case DFKI should notice or receive any indication that an external offer to which it has linked might cause civil or criminal liability, DFKI will immediately delete this link.
