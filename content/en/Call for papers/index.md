## BLEMORE Workshop and Competition on Multimodal Blended Emotion Recognition at ACIIâ€™25

https://blemore.github.io/workshop/

Humans often experience multiple emotions simultaneously, such as feeling both sadness and anger when facing an unjust 
loss or happiness and surprise at a birthday party. However, emotion recognition research has largely focused on single 
emotions due to limited datasets and a lack of awareness. BLEMORE aims to bridge this gap by advancing the recognition 
of multimodal blended emotional expressions. We invite submissions on blended emotion recognition in two tracks: a 
general track and a challenge track. In the general track, we invite submissions relevant for the topic of blended 
emotion recognition. These submissions may address a range of different problem formulations and research questions. 
The challenge track introduces a novel dataset of multimodal emotion expressions that contains both single emotions 
and blended emotions conveyed with similar and varying proportions. Papers addressing the BLEMORE challenge will follow a pre-defined evaluation protocol.  

**1. General Track:** Here, we invite submissions concerned with the general problem of blended emotion recognition. 
Submissions may address the problem using a variety of modalities and datasets. In addition to novel computational approaches, 
we also encourage submissions that enhance our understanding of the problem of blended emotion recognition. Evaluation on the challenge dataset is not required but will still be valued.


**2. Challenge Track:** In this track, we invite submissions which utilize the challenge dataset and pre-defined evaluation metrics. 
We employ two evaluation metrics: _ACCpresence_ measures whether the correct label(s) are predicted without errors. 
A correct prediction must include all present emotions while avoiding false negatives 
(e.g., predicting only one emotion in a blend of two emotions) and false positives 
(e.g., predicting emotions that are not part of the label). _ACCsalience_ extends _ACCpresence_ by considering the relative prominence of each emotion. 
It evaluates whether the predicted proportions reflect the correct ranking. This metric applies only to blended emotions. 
Further details on the challenge can be found [here](https://blemore.github.io/workshop/challenge/)
